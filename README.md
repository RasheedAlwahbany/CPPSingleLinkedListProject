# C++ Single Linked List Project
This is C++ single linked list project

# What is C++
C++ is an object-oriented programming language which gives a clear structure to programs and allows code to be reused, lowering development costs. C++ is portable and can be used to develop applications that can be adapted to multiple platforms.

# What is the Single Linked List
A Singly linked list is a collection of data called nodes, where each node is divided into two parts to store data and address at some random addresses. The pointer next, points to the address of the next node in a list. Compared to the array data structure, the size of the linked list elements is not fixed.
A singly linked list is a type of linked list that is unidirectional, that is, it can be traversed in only one direction from head to the last node (tail). Each element in a linked list is called a node. A single node contains data and a pointer to the next node which helps in maintaining the structure of the list.
